Introduction
============

What does it do?
----------------
This extension provides a "One-Click" translation solution for TYPO3 pages. It scans all content elements on a page (including Mask elements, DCE, and IRRE) and translates them into the target language while strictly preserving the HTML markup.

Features
--------
* Automatic translation of `tt_content` records.
* Support for IRRE (child records) translation.
* Support for Flexforms (DCE/Mask).
* **Advanced HTML Protection**: Tables, Figures, and CSS classes remain unchanged.
* Multi-language support.
